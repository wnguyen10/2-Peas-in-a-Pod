       "\"Hey, this is culture shock a broadcast why for individuals at the Greer School? We're located in I roam Pennsylvania. My name is Helena Daniel. I'm Michaela Glover. My name is Diana.Very professional. Yeah, and today we are going to talk about some weird food in China that I don't even eat. Okay that's got here. The first one is called smelly tofu. I like this it is so good, even though it's smelly it but your it smells Melody, but we'll eat it. It's good. Yeah what to do. Yeah tofu.Yeah, I know. I used to make really good fried tofu. When I was in Hawaii had time to Foucault. Yeah, we have the original and the black taupe black love. What's black tofu. Is that it look black soybeans. No. No, I don't. I don't know tofu is made from soybeans. Oh, yeah, but I don't think this is only the outside is black. But inside is too much. Here's the smelly tofu in a you know care. I mean it is this it looks disgusting. I don't either sometimes white little It's anyone ever had spam staff spam. It's it's like it's like an ambush. It's it's a paste. It's a ham paste in a in a can. Oh you spread it's like a ham paste spread very processed. I don't I've never had it. So I'm just wondering how you see it a lot at gas stations and stuff. It's probably tastes like bologna or like Something of that nature and we have this yet. This this yeah are the that looks like is that the intestines you're talking about? Yeah, it tastes so good. But it's also a little bit smelly. I would I would guess probably doesn't smell very good. It's a lot of food in China. Like is it healthy or just some of them are compared to America know like, uh, I think it's every compared to America. I think ours might be a little bit better. Yeah, our most like American foods are like like fried something. Yeah, and oh, yeah, sweet. Oh my God, trying everything fried chicken and cheese burgers. Yeah and fried Oreos. So it's both fried and it's sweet fried Oreos are good. They're amazing. We're Americans. So you would understand. Yeah, I know. I see your face. It's very much sugar. Like it Twinkies. I don't like Twinkies. All the host is snacks are kind of gross. That's the hostess snacks are pretty American to me. So everyone look. All right. She's looking at us. It's a No-No me right? All right, she's not well she should you should someone like sweet food in China. It is called a bastard. Look, I know you don't worry. They're not know sweet potato squash is that like they are sweet potato is that when would you serve that like lunch dinner? Like yeah whenever you want to eat it. That's what I that's when we would have sweet potatoes. You're kind of like fried the sugar until it become a like like a syrup and then you put the sweet. It all in there and yes, never take this out and what you like take one from the plate see the the the yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yes, that's kind of stuff and that kind of looks like Yeah, looks like fried banana looks like orange chicken. Oh, no that no, we don't have orange. Chicken China. Yeah. I know the American Chinese food probably the novelty. Yeah. Sorry, but they are the worst. You know, like oh like I feel like every American Chinese food have some sort of cells but in China, uh-huh. Yeah. We love sauce. Especially if it's on wings, have you had wings? Yeah wings are like the do people like chicken wings in China. Yeah, by the way, like we're cool game. What kind of sauce you put on it? We don't know. I don't know we have so many. Do you probably like lightly fry it? Yeah, but just not like dousing it in oil. Well, you guys eat like all the parts of the animal. So I was that makes sense. Okay, what's the food like this? It's a it's a fact what it's a it's an egg. Oh, yeah, she's showing she's showing us a picture of colorful eggs. They look black on the outside. Yeah, it tastes really disgusting. It tastes like that kind of stuff. and So when do people usually eat these eggs? Is there any certain time or just know there? Is that like is that like a fancy food? No, just regular Smith from the oh, it's lime. Yeah, and they like put the lime cover the egg. So are they are they soaked in Lime? No, they're not. You cover them with lime from the outside. Yeah, and then when you take them out, it will become like this and that's why we have Bloody blood sausage. Okay, if that's so that's completely made of blood. It's blood so is it you cooked blood or? That is a food that Americans do not usually eat and you cook it and it's really good. No, I don't know if you ever noticed. I haven't eat this before. I don't want to eat that dude. A lot of Americans are like at least in the north were kind of against like Morgan's all you know other than liver some people like liver. I don't like state they probably do I am not Southern this is a kind of oh my I don't know. I haven't eaten this before. We don't really eat bugs either. and unless you're like oh it's like when I don't know. So is this like what kind of bug is that though rules into a more looks like a like a like a cockroach almost no sighs. So like the size of a cockroach. Is it Eden awful forms? for Eden or two Is it a food that you eat often or not? Really? Like in my Province we don't eat this I haven't used this before where some foods that you do eat often. I like to eat noodle, but we all know we have a lot of fried stuff and very sweet and fatty unless you guys have something like maybe weird American food. Yeah, I will show you accept. Okay, there's a lot of weird stuff in the South like Louisiana. I know some people from Louisiana that make they just like to combine everything together. Like there's this one. Deep dish pizza where they put like Mexican stuff on it. Wait, Lucy. It's so it basically just looks like a big mush of random stuff. What's in there? It's a beef cheese people. We love our Beauty and cheese a lot of cheese put cheese on everything love cheese. Yeah something that like a food that I think is really weird that my grandma makes every Christmas is a Jell-O salad. It's made troublesome. Yeah, and it has like gelatin and cottage cheese in it. And sometimes she puts nuts in it. It's just yeah, I don't like it. But a lot of my family do see how so that's one American thing. I am not blue cheese that tastes like that kind of stuff. I don't even know what cottage cheese is really it's just like curdled milk. This says that cause cheese is a fresh cheese curd product with a mild flavor and it is made by draining the cheese as opposed to pressing it. So that's why it's all chunky. I have a question though. Do you guys eat oatmeal in China? No. No, it's not traditionally. Yeah. Have you do you ever have like chicken and waffles missing not chicken waffles? Yeah, that's a that's another American thing. It's just yeah, like for breakfast how about chicken and waffle flavored potato chips? I but chicken waffles people often put gravy on them. And yeah, it's like I could N Waffles. Yeah not Can in waffles Oh, I thought it's to be in wallow. People do make that all people put bacon in their pancakes. sweet Yeah, you can actually get it in a lot of like breakfast restaurants. I like sweet potholes. Yeah, we'll have sugar in syrup with like any kind of bread any kind of like just a lot of sweets like breakfast and lunch and dinner a lot of us just eat a lot of sweets. And yeah. Most Americans do not eat enough vegetables. We just really like bread and cheese and more red. Yeah and meet. Yeah, that's probably also because like we were from Europe and that's like, uh, huh right thing. Yeah other we are soft you guys have I don't know. We don't really have much else but so are other any holidays that you eat certain foods for yeah. Yeah. No no lucky North we eat dumplings, but he's so ah, oh no, he's Health. We eat dumplings, but in North they eat. No way. That is north. Right? Yeah. Oh, yeah North Vietnamese and self they eat they eat. No, they don't like the traditional like the retractable. No, they don't so everyone is dumplings for for our Spring Festival. What's the Spring Festival about? It's our Chinese New Year. Oh, yeah. Yeah, can you guys give out some like little gifts and stuff usually like yeah, we give money and money. Yeah, we celebrated on my old school and they have the red pocket and the like older people will oh putting money in there. Okay. My school did that are Chinese teacher gave us money. It wasn't Boris give out hugs. Our sponsor today's degree or School sponsored by mrs. Forrest the provider of excellent education, please check out her website at www.beertown.org. Thank you and we have like lanterns and I don't know what's this called people hide under the like the big costumes and they oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh the dragons. Yeah. No, that's what it looks like in the sky. Honey, and what else do I have so we have that we have biggest holiday. Is it like July the 4th or all holidays are big. Yeah. It is to make it all a novelty. It's basically the holidays that will especially the ones that we get brakes on our Wellness Yeah Christmas Thanksgiving and then Easter and then Fourth of July. Yeah, we have Fourth of July in New Year's are usually and you and st. Patrick's Day. Those would be the three party holidays for sure, but please Patrick day isn't as much of like a respected holiday like st. Patrick's Day. We don't get like school off. Yeah, but you have people kind of go crazy. But um Christmas and Thanksgiving are more about like family and if you're religious, it's more about like religion and New Year's Eve and What's it called? The other one? No, New Year's Eve and July 4th are when people just drink a lot and I get dressed up and stuff. And we also have Labor Day and Veterans Day. So that's more celebrating certain people. Mmm. And for us we like birthdays for most of us are really important until a certain age, but Still often it's very important. Is it the same in China? He celebrate it really depends like me. I haven't celebrated my birthday for three years because I wasn't because I wasn't here. So the 18 is like the most important one because you know, you're an adult now and oh my God, I don't want to be a dog. We even celebrated. My grandma's wouldn't hundred and second birthdays. So it's just we like celebrating birthdays. Nobody in my family live that long. Well, I was wondering if you guys celebrate Thanksgiving. No, we don't have any International School like they gave you breaks and Are there any American holidays that you really celebrate Christmas but like they accept your if you're an international score like in a community where there's a lot of foreigners you don't it's not it's not legal for schools to give holidays on Christmas. So unless your international school or a private school, how is Christmas celebrated? Everything has a discount? It's like that's basically the opposite of America a lot of prices go up because parents go crazy and want to like buy it like a whole stock of toys for your kid. Hmm. We have Black Friday and then really everyone we also have Black Friday and we have a thing called double 11. Yeah. It's on November 11th. So just give you a bunch of coupons so you don't really get to save money. Yeah, and did you say online? Can you get coupons but speaker that what what kind of social media do you have in are you able to use things like Amazon or Amazon? Yes, but not Google. I like I don't like Amazon cuz they have solid stuff on there the end. Yeah, sometimes they are just very, you know, kind of ugly not that fancy and cute like Amazon in here in China. We have a thing called horrible really you can get everything from me and it's yeah. What was the thing that you said was the equivalent of Snapchat? Could we chat, but it's like Snapchat and Instagram combined? Yeah. Some Americans use WeChat, but not really think our most popular ones are like Snapchat Instagram and Twitter, right? Yeah. Do you guys still use Facebook or that's too old some people do use Facebook. I personally don't unless I'm using like the messaging feature of it. But no one uses it it's not like it's a big thing for the Millennials. I think so. It's more for like posting stuff for your grandparents. So so that's so Facebook is true old. So you guys don't use that. Yeah, my parents use it though. We're the most popular types of social media that you have in China. I think we yeah. It's going to be wait war which is like yeah, it's the equivalent of Twitter. And we also have a thing called cuckoo. It's like more fancy much more fancy. How is it more fancy? Like oh. Like there's more stuff on it, but it's less private. Oh, yeah, like for which I could just limit it to. Is it kind of for businesses or just in general? It's in general businesses use it for advertisement which is and so do you guys not really use Instagram? No, because we can't get access to a child. You have to use a VPN which is yeah. I've only seen a couple Chinese Instagram accounts. I most of the Chinese students at rare have them but yeah, I mean because they're in America. I mean like I mean, I've only seen a couple people posting like who live in Beijing and live in China we here Okay. Put on a VPN and go on and surrounding which uh-huh, uh-huh. It's like once in a while. And so when you say illegal like do a lot of well, yeah, but do a lot of people still do it or is it not something that is done? Especially during like the Garment or they have a big meeting new block all the beeping. Yeah for because we have laws against like downloading movies and music and stuff. But a lot of people do it. Anyways. Yeah, it's not like the thing we're using they're going to track you down and like be the action like you're fine or whatever but it's just hard to get access to. Oh, that's really interesting. It's great. Be able to learn so much about different cultures while being at the Greer school. Well, that's all the time we have for today. Thank you for listening to culture shock. Hi and Welcome to our show Disney villains 101. I'm Brianna one of the hosts and my co-hosts are Nina. Hi, I'm Nina Tina. Hi, I'm Tina. I'm Karina. This is Karina. And today we're going to be talking about family love with villains and their stepchildren.All those days watching from the windows all those years outside. First off Rapunzel and her stepmom everyone knows who that is, right? Yeah, but you know how she came to because you're they're not really a stepmother and step-daughter kind of relationship. It's more of like a mother/daughter, but they have no relationship exactly Prado blood. And that came about because Mother Gothel or Rapunzel's mom had found a flower right that yeah and Rapunzel's mom was sick. And so drank the flower or something. I don't know hate it. Yeah, so the so she has the power. Yeah. Okay, so that's why she took it and so basically her only reason for taking and raising upon Soul was to keep her Young and Beautiful. Yeah, right. Yeah. So what would you guys think is like the worst part about how she treated Rapunzel wow. Raising her. I think she just afraid of hunger will be find out by others. So she just lock her in the tower. And so it's just she will own on the power of the magic like will she will keep young not others. Okay. So what do you guys think about Rapunzel? I think like she is a naive princess because all she learned is from her mother's the found. Her mother's breathed up the book brings from her mother's And everything she learned is teach for her mother and she can't connect to the world also out of the tower. Oh, yeah, because she's always stuck inside never allowed out. Yeah, so they did come on the side and from people and development and she's I think she's very rely on her mother. So everything her mother says she believes it. He always kind of like her mom like yeah, so it's kind of like her mom Rolled her life and like kept her locked away and like he didn't yeah, I agree and I think she have no idea like to against her mother because it's she saw it's her real mother because when she is baby she have already she have already be locked in the tower and she thinks that the way that her mother treats her is the right way, right because she knows no other yeah, it has a different childhood because because because we are also teenagers, but she's just alone and she don't have friends. So like I feel like maybe she don't know something about outside War. She just knows something about like in her house and with her mom, right? Yeah, and how do you think Mother Gothel or her mother treated her while she was in there? Like not only did she lock her up and not let her outside but was she nice to her while she was in there? Yeah. Yeah like manipulation kind of I think I think she treat treat treat the proposal or not. We bad because she wants to gather power from her hair and like everything like she Rapunzel wants she will bring it like printing or eat the food the books and like and her I think she just wants you to go out and others ever everything. She can give it bring it to her. I think she treated not that right. Yeah, okay. How do you think her mom like bring all these different things like the books and the paint in the food bring it into the towers Rapunzel stuck. How do you think it made her want to leave more and like made her curiosity grow? I supposed to she sees a different world. She sees like the mountains and on all the other things that from nature and from the places that people live. I think she reads a lot of things from the book. And from the other thing that my mother brings to her and makes makes her very curious about what about all what is in our side? So you're kind of like saying like how she's really curious about what's outside because even though she's read it and she seen things. Yeah. She's never experienced it yet because the book like some story the book should never saw it before because he is just in the tower. She have no interest in life and the Lenten Which well causing the sky when during her birthday. I think it maybe it's really makes her want to go out and see what happened. Yeah, that makes sense because she wanted to see where it's coming from her why they were doing it. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. A dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes when you're fast asleep in dreams. You will lose being locked up and kept away from other people Cinderella's kind. Like that, right her stepmother and stepsisters always kept her in the Attic or in the house cleaning. Yeah, how do you think that made to drill a feel or how she like respond to that? I think like seeing the realest my stepmother treat her badly then the Rapunzel stepmother because like she just treat her like a made in house and doing the housework. I think it's will change seeing the real as my because when she is Childhood her mother is still alive and her father is is her mother father and mother is treated her very good, but after really good job. Yeah. Yeah, so she her childhood is very happiness. And but after she her mother dies and the stepmother come and bring her two daughters. They just treat her like I made it she knew to do the housework and she was very dirty every day and and also need to take care of her stepmother and two sisters. And I think like because because when she made her stepmom is like it's almost she's like growing up and she knows like she can't control everything because the Stepmom have like a really huge power and yeah, like she can't control and she can't change her life. Oh, so she's kind of you think she felt like traps there even if she tried to get out and get away from that. So she can write. Yeah. She couldn't go anywhere. How do you think like the loneliness affected her and how she always was around the house by herself. I think she's lonely because she is only live in the attic and nobody will talk to her that they stopped at step mother and sister just want to just ask her to everything's and she had no friends. So she just can't we talk to the my sword mice in the house and make fun with them. Like I think maybe she always have some dream about about like the outside world and a magic word. So like after that some like the good wizard help her but like but it's not the really truth. It has a time limit and and also she can't change because this is just a magic and it's not like a in the middle. Yeah, it's not a permanent change or solution and just gives her like a glimpse of what she could have. Yeah, so like it kind of makes her want to have more and she realizes that she could she just has to work harder for it kind of I think she while another reason that she didn't go out because I think she is very easy to stand mother and the two sister and her family members. Yeah, and even they treat a very bad. Yeah, he seems like okay. Yeah, take care of them. Yes. Yeah, and she's very kind because like whatever the sister will do. Yeah, like broke her necklace. Yeah, and like broke her dress, but she never blend them. She just cries. Yeah, I know for back. How do you think her going to the ball even against her someone's voice is like kind of Made her feel free more for like more like relieved for a night kind of yeah, that's her only chance to get out. I think because have some fun. Yeah, and I think it's also because they broke her mother's dresses like the dress. They won't she the birds and mice made for her to do you think it was kind of like a revenge for breaking and entering? Yeah dress that you like. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go anyways, yeah, I think it's a while way to against her stepmothers because you go to the right because he was able to show that she has some power over her life. Yeah sure and like she's so pretty like when she change her clothes with a magic and then go to that party and a lot of people saw her and maybe think oh, she's a good person or she's so kind. Yeah, they saw she is a princess like so she is so pretty. Yeah, so so maybe some people will ignore Cinderella's stepmom. And her two daughters. Yeah. Okay. So I think that's also why step her stepmother and two daughters will treat her so bad because she is so beautiful and she yeah and I think she is the real real daughter actually have need will have high title but her stepmother want just to her two daughters will have her title and use that instead of Cinderella the stepmother and her to sister. I think it's really ever about her like the face because she's because she's so pretty. Yeah. Okay. Yeah that makes sense because they were jealous and they wanted yeah, just a mom wanted her children to succeed and not I'm wishing for the one how do you guys think the difference is between Cinderella's stepmom and Snow White stepmom. Okay, first off it's no it's my mom tried to kill her twice. Yeah, and Cinderella's mom just was mean. Yeah, just me and Makemake makes her like work very hard. Yeah, like locks her up and just doesn't treat her right but I mean also if you look at it from different perspectives perspectives there also during different time periods. Yeah, actually, I think the Snow White's stepmom like didn't so Snow White like you're really everyday child. Yeah, because you like she's just like ask them Miro like who is a like the most crazy woman in the world we are because she's very self-centered very like she is very common and she's the prettiest but the mirror told her the Snow White is more beautiful than exactly so she wanted dispose of her. So make sure she was always on top. Yeah. Yeah, actually she hahaha So how do you guys think that the way Snow White's evil stepmother one about killing her was smart and like why do you think she wanted to kill her? I think she does things know what is her daughter because she just think it's a woman that who is pewter good beautiful down her and she is very curious about that and she just want to kill a girl or woman is not her daughter I think and her stepmom is really care about the appearance. So what do you guys think on like how like it was kind of smart how she killed her like how instead of just straight up giving her poison. She kind of transformed herself into looking like a different person looking like night making her like she took advantage of snow. It's naiveness by making herself look like an older woman who is helpless. Yeah and giving her food because she just could write. Yeah. I think she just don't want like I think she liked become like old woman. I think she's don't want other people will Nice tits. She the evil queen kill the Snow White. I think the evil queen just want other know. It's all just an accident. So it looked like he was just yeah, actually, yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. Why do you think that evil queen decided to use an apple out of all things to poison Snow White? I think it's because I hold is a very normal things and everyone will eat is so it's no one will now be you know, be aware of that. It is a poison or it may cause her death. Yeah, and apple is a common fruit. She just yeah just like an apple and it's matter. Yeah. It's not pointed healthy like okay. Yeah, and it's easy to like to make Appleby color for oh, yeah. And by the way, our sponsor is evil queens apple orchard. There are apples are red organic and chemical free. So get an Apple from evil queen for your health. All right.
