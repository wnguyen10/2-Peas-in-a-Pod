"It's Not About You - Trauma, PTSD, Abuse & Recovery - Joe Ryan",spotify:show:3JsBwMyHyqSuBK8l3mowDh,"This Podcast is not about flash, pretending, or promises, just real, genuine, vulnerable, and honest talk. People around you will take your recovery personly; it's not about them. There are no quick fixes from trauma, abuse, addiction, PSTD, or recovery. Knowing what happened to you is only part of the process, we have to relive the feelings, emotions, and scenes we avoid. When we stop blaming, making excuses and take responsibility for our own emotions, thats the start of moving from victim to surviving, from surviving to survivor and finally to thriving and teaching.
